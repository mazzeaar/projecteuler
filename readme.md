# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to some problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). The solutions are written in C++ and are organized by problem number. They are neither efficient nor elegant, but they are solutions.

## How to Use

To compile and run a specific problem, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory of the problem you wish to solve.
2. Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
make && ./main {problem number}
```

To generate a new problem file based on 'euler_template.cpp', use the following command:

```bash
./new.sh {problem number}
```

The new file will be created in 'src/problems/euler{problem number}.cpp'. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute your own solutions!
